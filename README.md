# Hello, I am @DiddiLeija

>**_Hi, I'm @DiddiLeija, I'm interested on the @pypa / @python projects, and I want to collaborate with them._**

**Hello, I am Diego, but you can call me Diddi.**

I am a code lover who wants to make something for the community :earth_americas:. In the real world, I like to play
videogames :video_game: and help my local community with desktop applications :man_technologist: :hammer_and_wrench:. But when I get into the digital world,
I just roam around, looking for something to collaborate on :thinking:... I'm a 
[PSF member](http://python.org/users/DiddiLeija) and a [Python](http://python.org) :snake: follower. I hope that one day I will
make a significant change for the Python developers...

I have a rare mind filled up with ideas to share just with you :smile:!

## About me

GitHub made a list to describe myself. And this is what I am:

- :telescope: I’m currently working on Python packaging projects \(on GitHub\) and GUIs/games \(locally\).
- :seedling: I’m currently learning how to use [pygame](http://pygame.org) on my projects.
- :octocat: I’m currently writing code with [Atom](http://atom.io) :atom: and [GitHub](http://github.com) :octocat:.

- :man: Pronouns: He/Him.
- :zap: Fun Fact: I look like a bot, I think like a bot, but I am a real human :man:!
