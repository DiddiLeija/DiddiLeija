Ah, if this changes in the future, I became an A++ in the GitHub stats.

```python

```

**Hello, I am Diego, but you can always call me Diddi...**

I am a code lover who wants to make something for the community :earth_americas:. In the real world, I like to eat wonderful food :pizza:
:cut_of_meat: :taco: and also play videogames :video_game: (I personally _love_ retro games :tv:) and chess :chess_pawn:.
But when I get into the digital world, I just roam around, looking for something (or someone) to collaborate with :thinking:... I'm a 
[PSF member](http://python.org/users/DiddiLeija), a [PyPA](https://pypa.io) member and a [Python](http://python.org) lover :snake:. I hope that one day I will
make a significant change for the Python developers...

I have a rare mind filled up with ideas to share just with you :smile:!

<!---
Is this an easter egg? Yes, it is!

These are some "thank you, folks" messages.

The PyPA gave me my first developer opportunity in Pip. Thanks!
https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/9cf35b25e25a47b41480d5b2dc82b8ebd1eeb6a0/AUTHORS.txt#L193

Thea Flowers, and the Nox team, also helped me a lot to grow!

The most important collaboration (for me) is with **[pypa/pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip)**, where I've been doing
[trivial changes and giving help with some issues](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues?q=author%3ADiddiLeija). Since that, I've been
working on other projects, on trivial issues and proposals. Also, I've been working on my own projects.

## A list about me :memo:

GitHub made a list to describe myself on this `README` file. I extended it and got this (somehow funny) description:

- :telescope: I’m currently working on Python packaging projects, GUIs, games and websites.
- :seedling: I’m currently learning to make Android apps with Kotlin.
- :octocat: I’m currently writing code with [Atom](http://atom.io) :atom: and [GitHub](http://github.com) :octocat:.
- :thinking: I’m looking for help with my GitHub repos \(I need ideas to make them grow\).
- :mailbox: How to reach me: [Send me an e-mail](mailto:dr01191115@gmail.com).
- :heart: I love [Nintendo](http://nintendo.com) :video_game: \(specificly, [Super Mario](http://mario.nintendo.com) :mushroom:\), [Star Wars](https://starwars.com) :movie_camera:, [The Strokes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strokes) :guitar: and [Python](http://python.org) :snake:.
- :man: Pronouns: He/Him.
- :fork_and_knife: Favorite foods ('cause I can't say just one :sweat_smile:): Calzone, pizza, tacos, steak, moussaka, etc. :yum:
- :zap: **Fun Fact:** I look like a bot, I think like a bot, but I am a real human :man:!
- :zap: **Fun Fact:** I am a developer at [GitHub](https://github.com), a curious at [Python Discussions](https://discuss.python.org) and a bounty hunter on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com)

## My `github.io` website :earth_americas:

Now, I have a personal website on [github.io](http://github.io). View it _**[here](http://DiddiLeija.github.io)**_. I'll be posting some stuff there, so I recommend you to
stay alert!

## How to help my mission :smiley:

> Join me, and together, we can rule the galaxy.
> \- Darth Vader

Well... we don't have the power to rule the galaxy _(not yet :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)_, but we can build cool, useful stuff together. Why don't you take a look to my
repositories, and maybe find good ways to improve them? I will appreciate anything you could do for me and my projects...

Also, if you want to support me, you can leave me a tip on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com).
I would appreciate anything you can do to support my open source work!
