<!--- Ah, if this changes in the future, I became an A++ in the GitHub stats. (Date: 01/10/2022) --->

```python
print("Hello, I am DiddiLeija.")
```

**Hello, I am Diego, but you can always call me Diddi...**

I am a code lover who wants to make something for the community :earth_americas:. In the real world, I like to eat wonderful food :pizza:
:cut_of_meat: :taco: and also play videogames :video_game: (I personally _love_ retro games :tv:) and chess :chess_pawn:.
But when I get into the digital world, I just roam around, looking for something (or someone) to collaborate with :thinking:... I'm a 
[PSF member](http://python.org/users/DiddiLeija), a [PyPA](https://pypa.io) member and a [Python](http://python.org)ista :snake:. I hope that one day I will
make a significant change for the Python developers...

I have a rare mind filled up with ideas to share just with you :smile:!

<!---
Is this an easter egg? Yes, it is!

These are some "thank you, folks" messages.

The PyPA gave me my first developer opportunity in Pip. Thanks!
https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/9cf35b25e25a47b41480d5b2dc82b8ebd1eeb6a0/AUTHORS.txt#L193

Thea Flowers, and the Nox team, also helped me a lot to grow!
https://github.com/theacodes/nox/graphs/contributors

The most important collaboration (for me) is with **[pypa/pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip)**, where I've been doing
[trivial changes and giving help with some issues](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues?q=author%3ADiddiLeija). Since that, I've been
working on other projects, on trivial issues and proposals. Also, I've been working on my own projects.

## A list about me :memo:

GitHub made a list to describe myself on this `README` file. I extended it and got this (somehow funny) description:

- :telescope: I’m currently working on Python packaging projects, GUIs, games and websites.
- :seedling: I’m currently learning to make Android apps with Kotlin.
- :octocat: I’m currently writing code with [Atom](http://atom.io) :atom: and [GitHub](http://github.com) :octocat: [^1].
- :thinking: I’m looking for help with my GitHub repos \(I need ideas to make them grow\).
- :mailbox: How to reach me: [Send me an e-mail](mailto:dr01191115@gmail.com).
- :heart: Things I love:
  - [Nintendo](http://nintendo.com) stuff :video_game: \(specificly, the [Super Mario](http://mario.nintendo.com) saga :mushroom: :turtle: :star:\)
  - The [Star Wars](https://starwars.com) saga :movie_camera:
  - [The Strokes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strokes) :guitar:
  - And of course, [Python](http://python.org) :snake:!
- :man: Pronouns: He/Him.
- :fork_and_knife: Favorite foods [^2]: Calzone, pizza, tacos, steak, moussaka, etc. :yum:
- :man_technologist: **Am I open for a new job?** Nope. But maybe in the future!
- :zap: Finally, **some fun facts and "unnecessary" stuff:**
  - :man: I am a real human, don't worry!
  - :man_technologist: I am a developer at [GitHub](https://github.com), a curious at [Python Discussions](https://discuss.python.org) and a bounty hunter on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com)

## My `github.io` website :earth_americas:

Yup, I have a personal website made with GitHub Pages. It can be found as **[diddileija.github.io](http://diddileija.github.io)** [^3]. I like posting stuff and updates there,
so I recommend you to stay alert! It's not a five-star site, but I hope it's somehow useful :)

## How to help my mission :smiley:

> Join me, and together, we can rule the galaxy.
> \- Darth Vader

Well... we don't have the power to rule the galaxy _(not yet :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)_, but we can build cool, useful stuff together. Why don't you take a look to my
repositories, and maybe find good ways to improve them? I will appreciate anything you could do for me and my projects...

[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/G2G3AL6D6)

Also, if you want to support me, you can leave me a tip on Ko-fi (just click the lil' red button above :point_up:). I would appreciate anything you can do to
support my open source work! No one paid me to be a developer (and no one does now), so your support will be my motivation to keep doing what I love!

DiddiLeija/DiddiLeija is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.

[^1]: Ah, btw, you can now see my GitHub Skyline at https://skyline.github.com/DiddiLeija!
[^2]: 'cause I can't say just one "favorite food", right? :sweat_smile:
[^3]: You'll might ask why is my website hosted at `github.io`, when I could use GitHub Pages on a personal website (`DiddiLeija.com` or sth like that). Well... I need money to have an independent website, as far as I understand :money_with_wings:
