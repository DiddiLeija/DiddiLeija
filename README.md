Hi, I'm @DiddiLeija, I love Python 🐍
and the Python projects. I'm ready to
collaborate!

- :telescope: I’m currently working on Python packaging and GUIs.
- :seedling: I’m currently learning how to improve my Python GUIs.
- :thinking: I’m looking for help with my [aleat3](http://github.com/diddileija/aleat3) package.
- :mailbox: How to reach me: [Press here to send me an e-mail](mailto:dr01191115@gmail.com).
