# Hello, I am @DiddiLeija

>**_Hi, I'm @DiddiLeija, I'm interested on the @python projects, and I want to collaborate with them. Also a @pypa member._**

****

```python
print("Hello, I am DiddiLeija.")
```

**Hello, I am Diego, but you can always call me Diddi.**

I am a code lover who wants to make something for the community :earth_americas:. In the real world, I like to play
videogames :video_game: and help my local community with desktop applications and websites :man_technologist: :hammer_and_wrench: (I haven't published them yet). 
But when I get into the digital world, I just roam around, looking for something to collaborate on :thinking:... I'm a 
[PSF member](http://python.org/users/DiddiLeija), a PyPA member and a [Python](http://python.org) :snake: follower. I hope that one day I will
make a significant change for the Python developers...

I have a rare mind filled up with ideas to share just with you :smile:!

<!---------------------------
The PyPA gave me my first opportunity. Thanks!

https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/a974526a0a07746fb1fbe07a764eb067e164a0c7/AUTHORS.txt#L190
---------------------------->

The most important collaboration (for me) is with **[pypa/pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip)**, where I've been doing
[trivial changes and giving help with some issues](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues?q=author%3ADiddiLeija).
My favorite personal repository is named **[text\_formatter](http://github.com/diddileija/text_formatter)**. If you like the __text\_formatter__ proposals, 
please [help me with your ideas or solutions to my current problems](http://github.com/diddileija/text_formatter/issues)...

## A list about me

GitHub made a list to describe myself on this `README` file. I extended it and got this description:

- :seedling: I’m currently learning to improve my C++ code.
- :octocat: I’m currently writing code with [Atom](http://atom.io) :atom: and [GitHub](http://github.com) :octocat:.
- :thinking: I’m looking for help with my packages \(I need ideas to make them grow\).
- :mailbox: How to reach me: [Send me an e-mail](mailto:dr01191115@gmail.com).

- :man: Pronouns: He/Him.
- :zap: Fun Fact: I look like a bot, I think like a bot, but I am a real human :man:!

## My `github.io` website

Now, I have a personal website on [github.io](http://github.io). View it _**[here](http://DiddiLeija.github.io)**_. I'll be posting some articles there, so I recommend you to
stay alert!

## How to help my mission

> Join me, and together, we can rule the galaxy.
> \- Darth Vader

Well... we don't have the power to rule the galaxy _(not yet)_, but we can build cool, useful stuff together. Why don't you take a look to my
repositories, and maybe find good ways to improve them? I will appreciate anything you could do for me and my repos...
