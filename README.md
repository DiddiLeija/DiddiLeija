# Hello, I am @DiddiLeija

>**_Hi, I'm @DiddiLeija, I'm interested on the @pypa / @python projects, and I want to collaborate with them._**

**Hello, I am Diego, but you can call me Diddi.**

I am a code lover who wants to make something for the community :earth_americas:. In the real world, I like to play
videogames :video_game: and help my local community with desktop applications and websites :man_technologist: :hammer_and_wrench: (I haven't published them yet). 
But when I get into the digital world, I just roam around, looking for something to collaborate on :thinking:... I'm a 
[PSF member](http://python.org/users/DiddiLeija) and a [Python](http://python.org) :snake: follower. I hope that one day I will
make a significant change for the Python developers...

I have a rare mind filled up with ideas to share just with you :smile:!

By now, I collaborated with **[pypa/pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip)** with [trivial changes and issues](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues?q=author%3ADiddiLeija). 
My favorite personal repository is named **[text_formatter](http://github.com/diddileija/text_formatter)**. If you like __text_formatter__, 
please [help me with your ideas](http://github.com/diddileija/text_formatter/issues/7)...

## About me

GitHub made a list to describe myself. I extended it and got this description:

- :telescope: I’m currently working on Python packaging projects \(on GitHub\) and GUIs/games/web pages \(locally\).
- :seedling: I’m currently learning how to use [pygame](http://pygame.org) on my projects.
- :octocat: I’m currently writing code with [Atom](http://atom.io) :atom: and [GitHub](http://github.com) :octocat:.
- :thinking: I’m looking for help with my packages \(I need ideas\).
- :mailbox: How to reach me: [Press here to send me an e-mail](mailto:dr01191115@gmail.com).
- :heart: I'm in love with [Nintendo](http://nintendo.com) :video_game: (specifying, Super Mario!), [Python](http://python.org) :snake: and [C++](http://isocpp.org) :computer:.
- :man: Pronouns: He/Him.
- :zap: Fun Fact: I look like a bot, I think like a bot, but I am a real human :man:!
