<!--- Ah, if this changes in the future, I once became an A++ in the GitHub stats. (Date: 01/10/2022) --->

```python
print("Hello, I am DiddiLeija.")
```

**Hello, I am Diego, aka DiddiLeija...**

I am a programming apprentice who wants to make something for the community :earth_americas:. Out of the internet, I like to eat wonderful food :pizza:
:cut_of_meat: :taco:, play videogames :video_game: and chess :chess_pawn:.
When I get into the digital world, I just roam around, looking for something new to do or improve :thinking:... I'm a 
[PSF member](http://python.org/users/DiddiLeija), a [PyPA](https://pypa.io) member and a [Python](http://python.org)ista :snake:.

<!---
Is this an easter egg? Yes, it is!

These are some "thank you, folks" messages.

The PyPA gave me my first developer opportunity in Pip. Thanks!
https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/9cf35b25e25a47b41480d5b2dc82b8ebd1eeb6a0/AUTHORS.txt#L193

Thea Flowers and the Winterbloom folks supported me a lot!
https://github.com/theacodes/nox/graphs/contributors

The most important collaboration (for me) is with **[pypa/pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip)**, where I've been doing
[trivial changes and giving help with some issues](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues?q=author%3ADiddiLeija). Since that, I've been
working on other projects, on trivial issues and proposals. Also, I've been working on my own projects.

## A list about me :memo:

This was intended to be a list to describe myself (or at least partially), but ended up being a (somewhat funny) description:

- :telescope: I’m currently working on Python stuff (mostly games and personal stuff).
- :seedling: I’m currently learning to code in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) :man_technologist:. I'm also [getting started with AI](http://github.com/DiddiLeija/ai-fundamentals) :robot:
- :octocat: I’m currently writing code with [GitHub](http://github.com) [^1].
- :thinking: I’m looking for contributors to help with my GitHub repos, such as my games :hugs:
- :mailbox: How to reach me: [Send me an e-mail](mailto:dr01191115@gmail.com) or [meet me at Discord](https://diddileija.github.io/discord).
- :man: Pronouns: He/Him.
- :fork_and_knife: Favorite food<b>s</b> [^2]: Calzone, pizza, tacos, steaks, sushi... etc :yum:
- :man_technologist: **Am I open for a job?** Currently no, but maybe in the future!
- :zap: Finally, **some quick facts you may want to know:**
  - :man: I am a real human, so will find me doing several human mistakes :sweat_smile:
  - :man_technologist: I like to hang out at a bunch of sites, the most common have been listed [here](https://diddileija.github.io/find_me), in case you want to meet me!
  - :atom: I'm still sad for [Atom](https://atom.io)'s recent death :pensive:.

<!-- Removed the following lines -- I'm looking for a better approach to say this! -->
<!--
- :heart: A few things I love:
  - [Nintendo](http://nintendo.com) stuff :video_game: \(specificly, the [Super Mario](http://mario.nintendo.com) saga :mushroom: :turtle: :star:\)
  - The [Star Wars](https://starwars.com) saga :movie_camera:
  - [The Strokes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strokes) :guitar:
  - And of course, [Python](http://python.org) :snake:!
-->

## My `github.io` website :earth_americas:

Yup, I have a personal website (via GitHub Pages). It can be found as **[DiddiLeija.github.io](http://diddileija.github.io)** [^3]. I like posting stuff and updates there,
so I recommend you to stay alert! It's not a five-star site, but I hope it's somehow useful :)

## How to support me :smiley:

> Join me, and together, we can rule the galaxy.
> \- Darth Vader

Well... we don't have the power to rule the galaxy _(not yet :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)_, but we can build cool, useful stuff together. Why don't you take a look to my
repositories, and maybe find good ways to improve them? I will appreciate anything you could do for me and my projects...

[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/G2G3AL6D6)

Also, if you want to support me, you can leave me a tip on Ko-fi (just click the lil' red button above :point_up:). I would appreciate anything you can do to
support my open source work! No one paid me to become a developer (and no one does now), so your support will be my motivation to keep doing what I love!

DiddiLeija/DiddiLeija is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.

[^1]: Ah, btw, you can now see my GitHub Skyline at https://skyline.github.com/DiddiLeija!
[^2]: 'cause I can't say just one "favorite food", right? :sweat_smile:
[^3]: You'll might ask why is my website hosted at `github.io`, when I could use GitHub Pages on a personal website (I like `DiddiLeija.com`, for example :star_struck:). Well... I need money to have an independent website, as far as I understand :money_with_wings:
