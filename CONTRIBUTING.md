# Contribution guidelines

## _Warning_: This repo has not any code.

[**DiddiLeija/DiddiLeija**](http://github.com/diddileija/diddileija) is a special repo for me. But it only stores my specific 
[README](http://github.com/diddileija/diddileija/blob/main/README.md) \(which appears on [my profile](http://github.com/diddileija/)\) and some
other things I use. So, contributing here is not so necessary. I only commit changes to keep my profile updated. So, changing the
contents is not good for me, ok?

## What about the issues?

I enabled the issues to discuss things that can affect all my public repos. I also handle these problems on my project board
["General proposals \(to all the repos\)"](http://github.com/users/diddileija/projects/3). _Those issues are the exception to the restrictions described
above_. On this issues, we can work on problems and features related to all my repos \(examples\: GitHub workflows, repository structures, etc.\).
